# Getting Started with Just Vibing Toolkit 🚀

Welcome to the Just Vibing Toolkit! This guide will get you up and running with AI-assisted development in just a few minutes.

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:
- Apply prompt templates for common tasks
- Leverage code templates for rapid development
- Integrate AI into your development workflow

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge in any language
- Access to an AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- A code editor or IDE
- Git for version control

## 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Choose Your First Chatmode (2 minutes)
Pick a chatmode that matches your current task:

**For New Features:** Use [Architecture Mode](../copilot-chatmodes/architecture-mode.md)
```
🏗️ I need to design a user authentication system for a web application.
```

**For Bug Fixes:** Use [Debug Mode](../copilot-chatmodes/debug-mode.md)
```
🐛 My login function is throwing an error: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
```

**For Code Review:** Use [Testing Mode](../copilot-chatmodes/testing-mode.md)
```
🧪 Please review this function and suggest comprehensive unit tests.
```

### Step 2: Apply a Prompt Template (2 minutes)
Use a prompt template for structured AI assistance:

**Code Review Template:**
```
Please review this [LANGUAGE] code for [SPECIFIC_CONCERNS]:

[YOUR_CODE_HERE]

Focus on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Best practices
- Testing needs

Provide specific suggestions with examples.
```

**Bug Fix Template:**
```
I'm encountering [ERROR_DESCRIPTION] in my [LANGUAGE] application.

Error message: [ERROR_MESSAGE]
Relevant code: [CODE_SNIPPET]
Context: [WHAT_YOU_WERE_TRYING_TO_DO]

Please help identify the root cause and suggest a fix.
```

### Step 3: Try a Workflow (1 minute)
Follow a simple workflow for your next task:

**Feature Development Workflow:**
1. 🎯 Plan with AI assistance
2. 🏗️ Design architecture
3. 💻 Implement with AI-generated code
4. 🧪 Create AI-assisted tests
5. 📝 Generate documentation
6. 👀 AI-enhanced code review

## Your First AI-Assisted Feature

Let's build a simple user profile feature to demonstrate the toolkit:

### 1. Planning with Architecture Mode

```
🏗️ I need to design a user profile feature for a web application with the following requirements:
- Users can view their profile information
- Users can edit their name, email, and bio
- Profile pictures can be uploaded
- Changes are saved automatically

Please suggest the architecture, database schema, and API design.
```

**Expected AI Response:**
- Component structure suggestion
- Database schema design
- API endpoint recommendations
- Security considerations

### 2. Implementation with Code Templates
Use the [REST API template](../templates/projects/rest-api/README.md) as a starting point:

```javascript
// AI-generated user profile controller
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// GET /api/profile - Get user profile
router.get('/profile', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.user.id)
      .select('-password');
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// PUT /api/profile - Update user profile
router.put('/profile', authenticateUser, validateProfile, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, email, bio } = req.body;
    const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(
      req.user.id,
      { name, email, bio, updatedAt: new Date() },
      { new: true, runValidators: true }
    ).select('-password');
    
    res.json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### 3. Testing with AI Assistance

```
🧪 Generate comprehensive unit tests for this user profile API controller:

[PASTE YOUR CONTROLLER CODE]

Include tests for:
- Successful profile retrieval
- Successful profile updates
- Authentication failures
- Validation errors
- Database errors
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

```
📚 Create API documentation for these user profile endpoints:

[PASTE YOUR CONTROLLER CODE]

Include:
- Endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Error codes and messages
- Authentication requirements
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've completed your first AI-assisted feature, here's what to do next:

### Explore More Tools
1. **Try Different Chatmodes**: Experiment with [Security Mode](../copilot-chatmodes/security-mode.md) or [Performance Mode](../copilot-chatmodes/performance-mode.md)
2. **Use More Templates**: Check out the [Templates section](../templates/README.md)
3. **Learn Advanced Prompts**: Explore the [Prompts library](../prompts/README.md)

### Integrate into Your Workflow
1. **Set Up Team Standards**: Establish AI usage guidelines for your team
2. **Create Custom Templates**: Build templates specific to your project needs
3. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**: Use AI for boilerplate generation and routine tasks

### Measure Your Progress
Track these metrics to see your improvement:
- **Development Speed**: Time to implement features
- **Code Quality**: Fewer bugs and better structure
- **Test Coverage**: More comprehensive testing
- **Documentation**: Better and more complete docs

### Effective AI Prompting

**Good Prompt Structure:**
```
[Context] I'm working on a [project type] using [technology stack]
[Goal] I need to [specific objective]
[Requirements] The solution should [requirements list]
[Constraints] Consider these limitations: [constraints]
[Request] Please [specific request with expected format]
```

**Example:**
```
I'm working on an e-commerce API using Node.js and MongoDB.
I need to implement a shopping cart feature.
The solution should handle adding items, updating quantities, and calculating totals.
Consider performance for high-traffic scenarios.
Please provide the controller code with error handling and validation.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**AI responses are too generic:**
- ✅ Provide more specific context
- ✅ Include relevant code snippets
- ✅ Specify your technology stack
- ✅ Ask for specific output format

**AI suggestions don't match your coding style:**
- ✅ Include examples of your preferred style
- ✅ Specify coding conventions
- ✅ Use custom chatmodes with style guidelines

**AI-generated code has bugs:**
- ✅ Always review and test AI-generated code
- ✅ Use AI for code review too
- ✅ Start with small, testable pieces
- ✅ Combine AI assistance with your expertise

### Getting Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more context you provide, the better the results
2. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on initial responses
3. **Combine Tools**: Use multiple chatmodes and templates together
4. **Review Everything**: AI is a tool to assist, not replace, your judgment
5. **Share Knowledge**: Learn from team members' AI interactions
